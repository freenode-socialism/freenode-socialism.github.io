# About Us

This is the website for the ##socialism channel on the freenode
network: a feminist space for discussion and education about
socialism, with an emphasis on the struggles of marginalized
communities and people. We are anti-capitalist, anti-racist,
anti-heterosexist, anti-cissexist.

We definine socialism as democratic control of the economic system by
society as a whole. We define feminism as a collection of movements
and ideologies aimed at eliminating political, economic, and social
inequalities between genders arising from structural oppression and
exploitation of those who arenâ€™t men.
